# fylo-landing-page

Technologies used:

- HTML

- CSS

Summary: 

Simple challenge provided by FrontendMentor which was a landing page for a website named Fylo.
Got more practice with my styling and HTML which was greatly appreciated. This whole website was mostly about spacing out
all the content which wasn't too hard.
